<h1>About</h1>

<p>
  Hi there, my name is Jason Perrin! I'm currently in my third year at UC
  Berkeley. I do a lot of technical work at the
  <a href="https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu">Open Computing Facility</a> involving
  <a href="https://puppet.com/">Puppet</a>,
  <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian Linux</a>, and
  <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>.
  I am also working part-time on
  <a href="https://engineeringblog.yelp.com/">Yelp's Operations team</a>.
