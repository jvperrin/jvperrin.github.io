<h1>About</h1>

<p>
  Hi there, my name is Jason Perrin! I'm currently an SRE on
  <a href="https://engineeringblog.yelp.com/">Yelp's Production Reliability team</a>
  and live in the Oakland, CA area.
  I also do some occasional technical work at the
  <a href="https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu">Open Computing Facility</a> involving
  <a href="https://puppet.com/">Puppet</a>,
  <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian Linux</a>, and
  <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>.
