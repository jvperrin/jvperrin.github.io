### Usage

To start up the site, install the [jekyll gem][jekyll-gem] and run `jekyll
serve` to start the [jekyll][jekyll-site] server.

If any changes are made to the JavaScript, compile and minify the JavaScript
into one file by running `grunt`. Make sure to have [Grunt][grunt] installed
first (`npm install -g grunt-cli`). If you create any new JavaScript files, add
them to the `Gruntfile` under the file list so they can be used in production.

Made using [One Nexus](one-nexus), a cool and underappreciated front end
framework. Unfortunately it isn't being actively developed right now, but it
still works great.
